## notes

Because this program takes a wrangler script as its only input, the flowchart will not work if the user inputs their own *header*, *pivot*, or *unpivot* transformations. 

For the same reason, it does not preserve column order, and all *move* transformations will be ignored. 

*settype* transformations do not show up in the flowchart.
