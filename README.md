# trifacta-wrangler

This tutorial walks through editing a sample dataset using the free tool Trifacta Wrangler, which is available for download [here](https://www.trifacta.com/start-wrangling/). The sample dataset used here is a csv of play-by-play data from the 2016 NFL season, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jlove29/trifacta-wrangler/blob/master/sampleData.zip).

Once Trifacta Wrangler is downloaded, select **new flow**â€”this will create a new flow in which you can organize your dataset. Then select **add datasets to flow**, and then **import dataset**.

From the import dataset window, you can either drag and drop playbyplay.csv, or **choose file** from your computer. Once you have done that, make sure your dataset is selected, then **add**.

####Trifacta Wrangler works by generating *scripts* that apply *transformations* to your data, and then compiling multiple scripts into a *recipe*. Multiple datasets and recipes are organized in a *flow*.

 
Trifacta Wrangler will automatically generate an initial *recipe* for your dataset.
